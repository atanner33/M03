#functions take data in, transform it, outputs it
#functions consider actions (verb)
#functions are a block of code that can be repeated when it's name is called.
# It can have data passed to it, and can return data as a result.

#to creare our own function, we first have to define it.
def myFunction():
    x=10
    y=15
    print(x+y)

#passing data to a function - create a parameter
def display_number(my_number):
    
def add_numbers(number1, number2):
    sum = number1 + number2
